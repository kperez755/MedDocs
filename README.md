# MedDocs

MedDocs is a collaborative project developed to create a secure and user-friendly medical document storage system. The goal of this system is to streamline the exchange of medical documents between patients and doctors, ensuring accessibility and privacy for all users.

## Project Overview

MedDocs was designed to address the growing need for a centralized platform where patients can view their medical documents sent by doctors, and doctors can access documents uploaded by patients. This project was developed in collaboration with classmates to deliver a seamless experience for both user groups.

### Key Features

1. **User Interface**
   - A responsive and intuitive user interface with workable buttons.
   - Placeholder functionalities to simulate document interactions.

2. **User Roles**
   - Basic differentiation between patients and doctors for potential role-based functionality.

3. **Future Expandability** 
   - Designed to incorporate document sharing, secure storage, and other features in future updates.

## Current Limitations

At its current stage, MedDocs is primarily a front-end application with the following limitations:

- No integrated database management.
- No authentication mechanisms for user sessions.
- No backend for handling data or implementing security.
- Lacks testing and deployment setup.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Python, Tkinter for creating the user interface.

## Team Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort, with team members focusing on the following aspects:

- **Frontend Development**: Designed and implemented the user interface.

## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges
- Building a functional and interactive user interface with limited backend support.

### Learnings
- Improved skills in front-end development and UI/UX design.
- Gained an understanding of project planning and potential feature integration.

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Management**: Integrate a database for secure and scalable data storage.
- **Authentication**: Implement user authentication for secure access.
- **Backend Development**: Add server-side logic and APIs for document handling.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Ensure system robustness and deploy to a cloud platform.
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile application for easier access.
- **Notifications**: Add real-time notifications for document updates or requests.
- **Integration**: Enable integration with third-party medical platforms and services.
